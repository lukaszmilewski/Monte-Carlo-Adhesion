# Researcher at Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences

## June 2022 â€“ September 2023

As a researcher at the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, I was involved in a project focused on investigating biological membrane adhesion through mesoscopic Monte Carlo simulations utilizing the Helfrich model. During this time, I developed a C++ application to conduct these simulations, and the detailed algorithm and results are outlined in a publication draft currently submitted.

### Responsibilities and Achievements:

- Developed a C++ application for mesoscopic Monte Carlo simulations using the Helfrich model to study biological membrane adhesion.
- Contributed significantly to the creation of impactful figures using vector graphics and Inkscape, enhancing the visual presentation of research results.
- Collaborated closely with team members to analyze simulation data and interpret results.
- Prepared and presented research findings at team meetings and scientific conferences.
- Worked on drafting a publication detailing the research methodology, results, and implications.

### Publication:

The research findings are outlined in a publication draft currently submitted. The corresponding source code for the C++ application is available upon request.
